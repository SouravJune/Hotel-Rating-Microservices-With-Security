# Hotel-Rating-Microservices-With-Security

Spearheaded the development of a cutting-edge, scalable, and high-speed backend application using microservices architecture, powered by Spring Boot, Rest APIs, and integrated with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB databases.

Implemented a user-centric approach, where users create accounts to rate hotels, provide feedback, and manage their profiles. Users have the capability to read, update, and delete their accounts and ratings.

Implemented robust security measures, including User Authentication and Authorization. Leveraged JWT tokens for secure communication within the microservices ecosystem.

Established a microservices ecosystem with each service autonomously registering in a service registry. Utilized technologies such as Rest Template and Feign Client to facilitate seamless communication between microservices.

Implemented strict access controls, allowing hotels to read all ratings but restricting their ability to update or delete any ratings.

Enhanced security further by integrating with OKTA to create a client for each microservice. This ensured secure communication and data exchange through JWT tokens.

Ensured a streamlined user experience by incorporating features like account management, feedback submission, and secure communication between microservices.
